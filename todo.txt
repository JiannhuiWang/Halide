1) Fix the bounds inference to use the provided bounds more effectively
2) Integrate inlining phase with existing overlap tiling phase
3) Implement a proper inlining pass (should fix local laplacian)
4) Explaing why the single child fusion is a restriction when doing inlining
   and is a general problem with Halide scheduling overall. Inlining effects
   all children and compute_at only works when there is a single child.

   Add an example of this to the test suite.
5) Check cost function sanity by implementing a large series of stencils
6) Check bounds inference by adding test cases where there are data dependent
   accesses
